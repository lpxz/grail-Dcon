Note:
1) we have several types of places: 
PlaceCommonLocal     // normal place node modeling the statement. 
PlaceMethodEntry     // an artificial place for modeling the entry of a method, its stmt attribute is empty
PlaceMethodExit      // an artificial place for modeling the method exit. All exits (returns) of a method connect to it. 
PlaceResource        // a place modeling the lock, its enclosingPM is empty.
PlaceControl		 // a place modeling the added control place
We need to substitute the type column of place into any of the five types. 

The place contains an attribute enclosingPM, telling what PetriMethod it is in.

2) PetriMethod is a unit of the Petri net graph. Essentially, it models a context-sensitive clone of a method. 
It helps managing the context information and inter-procedural invocations.
for its attributes, methodsig is used  (by soot or llvm) to identify the method. entry is the PlaceMethodEntry place. 

3) Given a violation, (p,c,r), it means that, p and c are statements executed by a thread in one atomic region, but interleaved non-serializabily 
by a remote thread executing r statement.
"pplace", "cplace" and "rplace" are the places modeling the statements p, c and r.

4) PetriCS is the Petri-net-version of CS (critical section). By Petri-net-version, we mean it is context-sensitive.
"resource" attribute is the PlaceResource place. "places" attribute tells what places are included.

5) Name convention: 
placename = "p" + place_id, for example, p14
transname ="t" + trans_id
arcname ="a" + arc_id
pmname ="pm"+ pm_id
vname="v" + v_id
pcsname ="pcs" + pcs_id

6) I use methodsig:jimplecode as the identifier of a stmt. This is special for java and soot. In llvm, different identifiers may be used.
